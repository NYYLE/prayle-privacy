    <h1>Delete Your Prayle Data</h1>

    <p>Prayle stores all of your data locally on your device. No personal data is stored on any server. This means you are always in full control of your data.</p>

    <h2>To delete all your data</h2>
    <p>Simply uninstall Prayle from your device. This will permanently remove all locally stored app data including notes, journal entries, goals, commitments, checklists, and any other content you have created.</p>

    <h2>To delete specific data</h2>
    <p>You can delete individual items directly within the app at any time. Items can be archived and permanently deleted from the Archive screen.</p>

    <h2>In-app purchase data</h2>
    <p>If you have made a purchase through Google Play, that transaction data is managed by Google. To request deletion of purchase records please visit <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay">Google Play Support</a>.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about your data please contact us at nyyle.business@gmail.com.</p>
