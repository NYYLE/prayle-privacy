    <h1>Privacy Policy for Prayle</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 27, 2026</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prayle ("the app") is a Christian life planner built for personal use. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when you use Prayle. By using Prayle, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you create in Prayle — including notes, journal entries, goals, habits, checklists, Bible notes, and doodles — is stored entirely and exclusively on your device. Prayle does not transmit, upload, share, or have any access to your personal data. No data is ever sent to any external server, cloud service, or third party by Prayle.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that while we designed Prayle to keep your data local and private, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure or reliable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security or integrity of data stored on your device. We strongly recommend making regular backups using the built-in export feature.</p>

    <h2>Data Backup</h2>
    <p>Prayle includes an optional export and import feature that allows you to save your data as a local file on your device. This backup file is stored in a location of your choosing on your device and is never transmitted, uploaded, or sent anywhere by Prayle. The backup feature is entirely local and offline. We are not responsible for any loss of data resulting from device failure, accidental deletion, or any other cause.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Prayle offers a one-time in-app purchase (Prayle Pro) processed entirely through Google Play. Prayle does not collect, store, or have access to any payment or billing information. All payment processing is handled solely by Google. For details on how Google handles your purchase data, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Prayle may request the following device permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong> — to allow you to save and load backup files and to add images to your dashboard. No files are accessed beyond what you explicitly select.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prayle does not request access to your camera, microphone, contacts, location, or any other sensitive permissions.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Services</h2>
    <p>Prayle uses the following third party services, each of which operates under their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> — for processing the one-time premium purchase. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> — standard Android platform services. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond the above, Prayle does not integrate with any analytics platforms, advertising networks, or data collection services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Prayle is intended for users aged 13 and over. Prayle does not knowingly collect, transmit, or share any personal data from any user, including children. Any content entered into the app by any user — regardless of age — is stored solely and locally on their device and is never sent anywhere. We recommend that users under 18 use the app with parental awareness. If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of Prayle, please be assured that no data entered into the app leaves the device.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can delete individual items within the app, or uninstalling Prayle will remove all locally stored app data from your device. There is no account to delete and no server-side data to request removal of.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or for legal reasons. Any changes will be reflected with an updated date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of Prayle after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this privacy policy or your data, please contact us at nyyle.business@gmail.com.</p>
